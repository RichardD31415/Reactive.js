    <h1>Reactive.js</h1>
    <p>
      Reactive.js is a simple reactive state management library that allows you
      to create reactive objects called Reactives that can be used to track and
      update state. It was designed to be used directly in smaller projects that
      need to monitor complex state pipelines, but don't need the overhead of a
      large library like Vue, React, or Angular.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose:</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted a simple reactive state management library that I could use in my
      projects without having to install a large library like Vue or React. This
      script is a simple implementation of the reactive state management pattern
      that I have used in projects. The big advantage of this library is that it
      is small, simple, and easy to understand without having to learn a large
      library.
    </p>
    <h2>How It Works:</h2>
    <p>
      The Reactive function creates a reactive object that allows tracking and
      updating of state using the get, set, watch, unwatch, and forget methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Derived function creates a derived state that depends on an array of
      reactives and a derivation function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Effect function creates an effect that watches a list of reactives and
      invokes a callback function when any of the reactives change.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can begin by importing our reactive function from the Reactive script
    </p>
    <code>import Reactive from "./reactive.js"</code>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Reactive: A reactive object that allows tracking and updating of state.
      </li>
      <li>State: The current state/data/value of a reactive object.</li>
      <li>
        Watcher: A function that is called when the state of a reactive object
        changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Derivation: A function that computes a derived state from an array of
        reactives. A Derivation IS a type of Reactive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Derived State: A state that is computed from an array of reactives using
        a derivation function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Effect: A function that watches a list of reactives and invokes a
        callback function when any of the reactives change. Think of it as a
        watcher for multiple reactives. An Effect IS NOT a type of Reactive.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reactive:</h2>
    <p>
      To create a reactive object, call the Reactive function with an initial
      state value:
    </p>
    <code>const reactive = Reactive("initial state");</code>
    <p>To get the current state at any time, call the get method:</p>
    <code>reactive.get(); // returns the current state</code>
    <p>To set the state, call the set method with the new state value:</p>
    <code>reactive.set("new state");</code>
    <p>
      It is a common mistake to directly set the state using the reactive
      object:
    </p>
    <code>reactive = "new state"; // This will break</code>
    <p>
      To watch for changes to the state, call the watch method with a watcher
      function:
    </p>
    <code>reactive.watch((state) => { console.log(state); });</code>
    <p>
      The watcher function will be called with the current state being passed to
      the function whenever the state changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To stop watching for changes to the state, call the unwatch method with
      the named watcher function you want to remove:
    </p>
    <code>reactive.unwatch(watcher);</code>
    <p>
      To stop watching for changes to the state all together, call the forget
      method:
    </p>
    <code>reactive.forget();</code>
    <p>This will remove all watchers from the Reactive, so use it carefully.</p>
    <p>
      All Reactive types (Reactive, Derivation) support input binding, text
      interpolation, and attribute binding.
    </p>
    <h2>Derived:</h2>
    <p>Start off by importing the Derived function</p>
    <code>import { Derived } from "./Reactive.js";</code>
    <p>
      To create a derived object, call the Derived function with an array of
      reactives and a derivation function:
    </p>
    <code>
      const derived = Derived([reactive1, reactive2], () => { return
      reactive1.get() + reactive2.get(); });
    </code>
    <p>To get the current derived state at any time, call the get method:</p>
    <code>derived.get();</code>
    <p>
      A Derivation IS a type of Reactive, so all Reactive methods are available
      to the Derived object. This means that you can use the set, watch,
      unwatch, and forget methods on the Derived object. Setting the state of a
      Derived object explicitly with <code>derived.set("new state")</code> will
      work, but it is not recommended as this bypasses the point of a Derived
      being a computed state.
    </p>
    <h2>Effect:</h2>
    <p>Start off by importing the Effect function</p>
    <code>import { Effect } from "./Reactive.js";</code>
    <p>
      To create an effect, call the Effect function with an array of reactives
      and a watcher function:
    </p>
    <code>
      Effect([reactive1, reactive2], () => { console.log("reactive1 or reactive2
      changed"); });
    </code>
    <p>
      An Effect IS NOT a type of Reactive, so it does not support the set,
      watch, unwatch, and forget methods. The Effect Function is just a helper
      function that allows you to watch multiple reactives with a single watcher
      function.
    </p>
    <h2>Bindings:</h2>
    <p>
      Bindings are a way to automatically bind inputs, text interpolations, and
      attributes to a Reactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bindings work with any Reactive, so they work with both Reactive and
      Derived objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      By binding to a Reactive, the state of the reactive will become the source
      of truth for the desired binding, updating values automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bind to a Reactive, pass a bindingString as the last argument to the
      Reactive or Derived function:
    </p>
    <code>
      Reactive("initial state", "bindingString");, Derived([reactive1,
      reactive2], () => { return reactive1.get() + reactive2.get(); }, "binding
      string");
    </code>
    <p>
      The bindingString can be any string, but it is recommended to use a
      descriptive string that describes the binding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the bindingString is set, the Reactive or Derived object will
      automatically bind to any inputs, text interpolations, and attributes that
      have the bindingString as an attribute.
    </p>
    <h3>Input Binding:</h3>
    <p>
      To bind an input to a Reactive, add the bindingString as a [input]
      attribute to the input:
    </p>
    <code>&lt;input [input]="bindingString" /&gt;</code>
    <p>
      The input will now automatically update the Reactive state when the input
      value changes, and the input value will automatically update when the
      Reactive state changes.
    </p>
    <p>Heres an example, below is a text input, bound to a reactive state.</p>
    <p>
      Input: <code>&lt;input type="text" [input]="reactive1" /&gt;</code>:
      <input type="text" [input]="reactive1" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have an input element, we can create a Reactive, and add a
      bindingString to it so it knows to get its value from the above input.
    </p>
    <code>const reactive1 = Reactive("Initial State", "reactive1");</code>
    <p>
      Notice how we are setting the initial state when we call the reactive
      function, and also notice how the input element's value is "Initial State"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we can add a watcher to this Reactive that logs to the console the
      value of state whenever it is updated.
    </p>
    <code>reactive1.watch((state) => { console.log(state); });</code>
    <p>
      Go ahead and open your browsers dev tools (CRTL + SHIFT + I), and then go
      to the console tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now type something into the input element, you'll notice that the console
      keeps logging out exactly what youre typing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And bam, just like that we've attached an input element to a reactive
      state with input binding all in less than 5 lines of code, no
      eventListeners to play with or explicit (imperitive) operational
      instructions. Our state now just knows to update itself and perform the
      watcher function automatically when the input changes.
    </p>
    <script type="module" defer>
      import { Reactive } from "./Reactive.js";
      const reactive1 = Reactive("Initial State", "reactive1");
      reactive1.watch((state) => {
        console.log(state);
      });
    </script>
    <h3>Click Binding:</h3>
    <p>
      To bind a click event to a Reactive, add the bindingString as a [click]
      attribute to the element:
    </p>
    <code>&lt;button [click]="bindingString"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;</code>
    <p>
      The Reactive will now automatically invert its state when the element is
      clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The click event can ONLY be bound to a Reactive that holds a boolean
      state, it will not work with complex state or other primative types.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lets try binding a button to a Reactive that holds a boolean state. First
      we need to create a Reactive with a boolean state.
    </p>
    <code>const reactiveBool = Reactive(false, "reactiveBool");</code>
    <p>
      Now lets create a button element and bind the click event to the Reactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Button:
      <code>&lt;button [click]="reactiveBool"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;</code>
    </p>
    <button [click]="reactiveBool">Click Me</button>
    <p>
      Now, as you click the button, you'll notice that the state of the Reactive
      inverts between true and false. Lets tie this state to a p tag and see its
      value update real time.
    </p>
    <p>Note: This example used text interpolation, which is covered below.</p>
    <code>
      &lt;p&gt;{ reactiveBool } (missing the second curly brackets on purpose to
      stop interpolation)&lt;/p&gt;
    </code>
    <p>{{ reactiveBool }}</p>
    <script type="module" defer>
      import { Reactive } from "./Reactive.js";
      const reactiveBool = Reactive(false, "reactiveBool");
    </script>
    <h3>Text Interpolation:</h3>
    <p>
      To bind a text interpolation to a Reactive, add the bindingString to the
      text interpolation brackets inside any element as content:
    </p>
    <code>&lt;p&gt;{{ bindingString }}&lt;/p&gt;</code>
    <p>
      The Reactive will now automatically update the text interpolation content
      when the Reactive state changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This strategy also works if there is content before or after the binding
      string:
      <code
        >&lt;p&gt;Some Content Before: {{ bindingString }} : And Some Content
        After&lt;/p&gt;</code
      >. The content before and after the bindingString will remain unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heres an example, below is a paragraph element, bound to a reactive state.
    </p>
    <p>
      First we initialize a new Reactive, lets call it reactive2. You can see
      that for the initial state we passed in an empty string, and then added
      the bindingString "reactive2" as the second argument.
    </p>
    <code>const reactive2 = Reactive("", "reactive2");</code>
    <p>
      We also create an input element and input bind the Reactive to that, but
      that step was completed above and will be skipped here on out.
    </p>
    <p>Now, lets create the paragraph element we want to interpolate into</p>
    <p>
      Paragraph:
      <code
        >&lt;p&gt;{ reactive2 } (missing the second curly brackets on purpose to
        stop interpolation)&lt;/p&gt;</code
      >: {{ reactive2 }}
    </p>
    <p>
      As you type in this input: <input type="text" [input]="reactive2" /> The
      value of the interpolation above also changes in real time
    </p>
    <p>
      This happens because the Reactive is using input binding to get the value
      of the input element, and then using text interpolation to insert that
      value into the paragraph.
    </p>
    <script type="module" defer>
      import { Reactive } from "./Reactive.js";
      const reactive2 = Reactive("", "reactive2");
    </script>
    <p>
      As you can see, weve now been able to bind a state to both an input AND an
      output that makes real applicational sense. All of this was acheived with
      just a single line of JavaScript, and simply adding a single attribute to
      your input and an interpolation in your paragraph. Only 1 new line, you
      were already making the input and p tag, those just took in some extra
      characters.
    </p>
    <h3>Attribute Binding:</h3>
    <p>
      To bind an attribute to a Reactive, add the bindingString value to any
      attribute surrounded by brackets to any element. class example below.
    </p>
    <code>&lt;p [class]="bindingString"&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;</code>
    <p>
      The Reactive will now automatically update the class attribute when the
      Reactive state changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This works for any attribute, including custom attributes:
      <code>&lt;p [custom-attribute]="bindingString"&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This strategy also works if the element already has the targeted
      attribute:
      <code
        >&lt;p class="existing-class" [class]="binding
        string"&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;</code
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The existing class will remain unchanged, but the value of the Reactive
      will be added to the classlist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lets try modifying the class of an element and make it display different
      styles as a result. First we need to make some style that we can target,
      so lets add a stylesheet with a few different color classes.
    </p>
    <code>.red { color: red; }</code>
    <code>.blue { color: blue; }</code>
    <code>.green { color: green; }</code>
    <style>
      .red {
        color: red;
      }
      .blue {
        color: blue;
      }
      .green {
        color: green;
      }
    </style>
    <p>
      Now lets create a Reactive and bind it to the class of a paragraph
      element.
    </p>
    <code>const reactive3 = Reactive("", "reactive3");</code>
    <p>
      Notice how we initialized the reactive with an empty string. Now lets
      create a paragraph element and bind the class to the Reactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paragraph:
      <code
        >&lt;p [class]="reactive3"&gt;Here is some text, Lorem ipsum dolor sit
        amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Fugit, recusandae!&lt;/p&gt;</code
      >
    </p>
    <p [class]="reactive3">
      Here is some text, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing
      elit. Fugit, recusandae!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as you type in this input:
      <input type="text" [input]="reactive3" />
      The class of the paragraph element will change to red, blue, or green
      depending on what you type.
    </p>
    <script type="module" defer>
      import { Reactive } from "./Reactive.js";
      const reactive3 = Reactive("", "reactive3");
    </script>
    <h2>Expressions:</h2>
    <p>
      Another quality of life feature of a Reactive is its ability to resolve
      template javascript expressions. Expressions are limited to only attribute
      binding and text interpolation (since it doesnt really make sence to add
      an expression to your input elements).
    </p>
    <p>
      Expressions are any valid JavaScript expression that returns a value.
      Expressions can also be used to access properties of the Reactive state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lets try adding an expression to our paragraph element from above. First
      we need to create a Reactive with a property on it.
    </p>
    <code> const reactive4 = Reactive({ property: "red" }, "reactive4"); </code>
    <p>
      Now lets add an expression to our paragraph element that will access the
      property on the Reactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paragraph:
      <code
        >&lt;p [class]="reactive4.property"&gt;Here is some text, Lorem ipsum
        dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Fugit,
        recusandae!&lt;/p&gt;</code
      >
    </p>
    <p [class]="reactive4.property">
      Here is some text, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing
      elit. Fugit, recusandae!
    </p>
    <script type="module" defer>
      import { Reactive } from "./Reactive.js";
      const reactive4 = Reactive({ property: "red" }, "reactive4");
    </script>
    <p>
      Expressions also supports almost any valid ES6 javascript. Lets create
      another reactive (5) and attach its length to an expression that
      determines the class on a p tag.
    </p>
    <code>const reactive5 = Reactive("", "reactive5");</code>
    <p>
      Paragraph:
      <code
        >&lt;p [class]="reactive5.length > 4 ? 'green' : 'blue'"&gt;Here is some
        text, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Fugit,
        recusandae!&lt;/p&gt;</code
      >
    </p>
    <p [class]="reactive5.length > 4 ? 'green' : 'blue'">
      Here is some text, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing
      elit. Fugit, recusandae!
    </p>
    <p>
      Type here:
      <input type="text" [input]="reactive5" />
      You'll notice that depending on the length of the string, the color of the
      p tag changes.
    </p>
    <script type="module" defer>
      import { Reactive } from "./Reactive.js";
      const reactive5 = Reactive("", "reactive5");
    </script>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
      Lets create a derived example, below are three input elements with the
      number type. As you type in values for each of the inputs, you'll notice a
      total value below being updated. This is happening because each of the
      inputs is bound to a Reactive value, and the total is bound to a Derived
      value that is computed from the three Reactive values.
    </p>
    <p>Lets create our reactives</p>
    <code
      >const reactive6 = Reactive(0, "reactive6"); const reactive7 = Reactive(0,
      "reactive7"); const reactive8 = Reactive(0, "reactive8");</code
    >
    <p>
      Now lets create our derived value that computes the total of the three
      reactives.
    </p>
    <code
      >const derived2 = Derived([reactive6, reactive7, reactive8], () => {
      return parseInt(reactive6.get()) + parseInt(reactive7.get()) +
      parseInt(reactive8.get()); }, "derived2");</code
    >
    <p>
      In the above derived, the first argument is an array of Reactives to
      monitor for a change, the second argument is a derivation function that
      calculates and returns the value of the derived based on the dependent
      Reactives, and the last argument is the bindingString.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now lets create our inputs and bind them to the Reactives, and create our
      total and bind it to the Derived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Input 1:
      <code>&lt;input type="number" [input]="reactive6" /&gt;</code>:
      <input type="number" [input]="reactive6" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Input 2:
      <code>&lt;input type="number" [input]="reactive7" /&gt;</code>:
      <input type="number" [input]="reactive7" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Input 3:
      <code>&lt;input type="number" [input]="reactive8" /&gt;</code>:
      <input type="number" [input]="reactive8" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Total:
      <code
        >&lt;p [class]="derived2"&gt;{ derived2 } (intentianlly misspelled the
        interpolation to stop binding: {{ derived-2 }})&lt;/p&gt;</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>{{ derived2 }}</p>
    <script type="module" defer>
      import { Reactive, Derived } from "./Reactive.js";
      const reactive6 = Reactive(0, "reactive6");
      const reactive7 = Reactive(0, "reactive7");
      const reactive8 = Reactive(0, "reactive8");
      const derived2 = Derived(
        [reactive6, reactive7, reactive8],
        () => {
          return (
            parseInt(reactive6.get()) +
            parseInt(reactive7.get()) +
            parseInt(reactive8.get())
          );
        },
        "derived2"
      );
      import { Effect } from "./Reactive.js";
      Effect([reactive6, reactive7, reactive8], (event) => {
        console.log(reactive6.get(), reactive7.get(), reactive8.get());
      });
    </script>
    <p>
      Thats pretty cool, and all of that is possible with just 6 lines of JS,
      and adding some attributes to the already existing html.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lets also add an effect, just for fun that console.logs some of the
      information from the events.
    </p>
    <code
      >Effect([reactive6, reactive7, reactive8], (event) => {
      console.log(reactive6.get(), reactive7.get(), reactive8.get());});</code
    >
    <p>
      Now, as you type in the inputs, you'll notice that the console logs the
      three reactives.
